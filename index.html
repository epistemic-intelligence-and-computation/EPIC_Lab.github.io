                The Epistemic Intelligence & Computation (EPIC) Lab is dedicated to advancing the principles necessary
                to
                developing epistemically intelligent systems, i.e. machine learning systems that can recognise, reason
                about,
                and communicate the limits of their knowledge.

                To achieve this, our research spans foundational theory to translational applications, focusing on
                knowledge-level
                uncertainty, commonly referred to as epistemic uncertainty.

                    : We study the mathematical and statistical
                    principles governing knowledge-level uncertainty, including representation (e.g. distributions v.s.
                    sets), quantification (e.g. information-theoretic v.s. discrepency-based), comparisons (e.g.
                    probability metrics), verification (e.g. statistical tests) of epistemic uncertainty.

                    : We develope machine learning algorithms that
                    can reason about, propagate, and communicate epistemic uncertainty in prediction (e.g. Gaussian
                    process, neural networks, conformal framework), inference (e.g. causal inference), and
                    decision-making (e.g. active learning, Bayesian optimisation).

                    We translate our theoretical
                    and algorithmic developments into practical AI systems within the broader trustworthy AI landscape,
                    addressing challenges such as interpretability and explainability, out-of-domain detections,
                    incentive-aware and
                    adverserial machine learning,AI safety, robustness, and language models.

            <strong>Why are we doing this?</strong> We believe that, although modern machine learning systems have
            achieved remarkable success in predictive and
            generative tasks — demonstrating powerful abilities to model statistical variability and patterns — their
            capacity to reason about uncertainty beyond observed data regularities remains fundamentally limited. In
            particular, forms of uncertainty arising from ignorance, ambiguity, and broader unknown-unknowns are not
            adequately captured by purely pattern-driven approaches. As reliance on such systems continues to grow,
            these
            limitations may lead to deeper structural challenges for reliability, robustness, and safety.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This gap motivates our research, which seeks to treat uncertainty as a first-class object of study rather
            than a secondary by-product of prediction. Our goal is to develop rigorous theory and algorithms to enable
            learning systems to represent,
            reason
            about, and communicate the limits of their knowledge — making uncertainty more than merely an afterthought
            or a set
            of error bars.</p>
